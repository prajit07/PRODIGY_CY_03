Poidog Password Strength Checker

This repository contains a simple yet effective Python program designed to evaluate the strength of a user's password and provide feedback based on specific criteria. The program checks for various elements such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to determine the overall strength of the password.

Features:
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase Letter Check: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.

Lowercase Letter Check: Verifies the presence of at least one lowercase letter.

Number Check: Ensures the password contains at least one numeric digit.

Special Character Check: Checks for the inclusion of special characters like @, $, !, %, *, ?, &, #.

How It Works:
Input: The user is prompted to enter a password.

Evaluation: The program evaluates the password against the defined criteria.

Feedback: Based on the evaluation, the program provides feedback indicating whether the password is very strong, strong, medium, or weak.

Usage:
To use this program, simply run the script and enter your password when prompted. The program will then analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength.

Note:
This program is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for real password security checks. Always use robust and secure methods for handling passwords in production environments.
